Each directory contains two files: an `exercise.hs` which needs to be changed
in some way (read the comments), and a `solution.hs` demonstrating one possible
solution. In order to test your changes, go into the subdirectory and run:

```
stack exercise.hs
```

Recommendation: *do not cheat*. Try to solve the exercise yourself without
looking at the solution.

Each file starts with a Stack script header, which ensures you have the right
compiler version and libraries available. If you're curious, you can [read more
about the script
interpreter](https://haskell.fpcomplete.com/tutorial/stack-script#script-interpreter).
